##	49. Select employee details from employee table if data exists in incentive table ?

	select * from EMPLOYEE where exists (select * from INCENTIVES)
	
-	Here "exists" statement helps us to do the job of If statement. 
-	Main query will get executed if the sub query returns at least one row. 
-	So we can consider the sub query as "If condition" and the main query as "code block" inside the If condition. 
-	We can use any SQL commands (Joins, Group By , having etc) in sub query. 
-	This command will be useful in queries which need to detect an event and do some activity.

##	97. Can you display the result from the below table TestTable based on the criteria M,m as M and F, f as F and Null as N and g, k, I as U

	Query:
	
		SELECT Gender,
		case 
		when Gender='i' then 'U' 
		when Gender='g' then 'U'

		else upper(Gender)
		end as newgender from TestTable GROUP BY Gender


##	98. What will be the result of the query below? 

		select case when null = null then 'True' else 'False' end as Result;

-	This query returns “False”. In the above question, 
-	we could see null = null is not the proper way to compare a null value.
-	To compare a value with null, we use IS operator in SQL.


		select case when null is null then 'True' else 'False' end as Result;
		

		select case when null is null then 'Queries In SQL Server' else 'Queries In MySQL' end as Result;		
		
##	100. How do you update F as M and M as F from the below table TestTable? 

		
		UPDATE TestTable SET Gender = CASE Gender WHEN 'F' THEN 'M' ELSE 'F' END


##	102. What is the difference between NVL function, IFNULL function, and ISNULL function?

-	These three functions work in the same way. 
-	These functions are used to replace NULL value with another value. 
	-	Oracle developers use NVL function, 
	-	MySQL developers use IFNULL function 
	-	SQL Server developers use ISNULL function.
	
	
##	Question 4: Write an SQL Query to check whether date passed to Query is the date of given format or not.

##	Question 5: Write an SQL Query to print the name of the distinct employee whose DOB is between 01/01/1960 to 31/12/1975.

	SELECT DISTINCT EmpName FROM Employees WHERE DOB  BETWEEN ‘01/01/1960’ AND ‘31/12/1975’;

##	Question 6: Write an SQL Query find number of employees according to gender  whose DOB is between 01/01/1960 to 31/12/1975.

		SELECT COUNT(*), sex from Employees  WHERE  DOB BETWEEN '01/01/1960' AND '31/12/1975'  GROUP BY sex;

##	Question 11: Write SQL Query to find duplicate rows in a database? and then write SQL query to delete them?


		SELECT * FROM emp a WHERE rowid = (SELECT MAX(rowid) FROM EMP b WHERE a.empno=b.empno)

		DELETE FROM emp a WHERE rowid != (SELECT MAX(rowid) FROM emp b WHERE a.empno=b.empno);

##	Question 12: There is a table which contains two column Student and Marks, you need to find all the students, whose marks are greater than average marks i.e. list of above average students.
		
		SELECT student, marks from table where marks > SELECT AVG(marks) from table)

##	Question 13: How do you find all employees which are also manager? .

		SELECT e.name, m.name FROM Employee e, Employee m WHERE e.mgr_id = m.emp_id;

		
##	Question 14: You have a composite index of three columns, and you only provide the value of two columns in WHERE clause of a select query? Will Index be used for this operation? For example if Index is on EmpId, EmpFirstName, and EmpSecondName and you write query like


	SELECT * FROM Employee WHERE EmpId=2 and EmpFirstName='Radhe'

-	If the given two columns are secondary index column then the index will not invoke, 
-	but if the given 2 columns contain the primary index(first column while creating index) then the index will invoke.
-	In this case, Index will be used because EmpId and EmpFirstName are primary columns.

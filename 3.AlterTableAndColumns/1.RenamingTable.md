# 	Rename Table Using SQL ALTER Table

-	You must have often come across a situation when you have already created a table but need to rename it.
- 	There are two ways to do so.

	-	1. 	Deleting the whole table and recreating from scratch
	-	2.	The second way of renaming a table is by using ALTER TABLE data manipulation language (DDL) statement.
	
	Query:
	
		CREATE TABLE test 
		 (
		  test_name  VARCHAR2 (15)
		 );
		
		
		ALTER TABLE  old_name_of_table  RENAME TO  new_name_of_table;


		ALTER TABLE  test  RENAME TO  example;
		
		CREATE TABLE emp
		(
			emp_id NUMBER(3),
			emp_name varchar2(30),
			emp_salary NUMBER(5),
			CONSTRAINT emp_id_pk PRIMARY KEY (emp_id)
		);

		ALTER TABLE emp RENAME TO employee;

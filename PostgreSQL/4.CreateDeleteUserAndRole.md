#	PostgreSQL Create, Alter, Add, Drop USER

##	PostgreSQL Create a User SQLShell (Command Line)

-	CREATE USER
	
		CREATE USER tom;
		CREATE USER tom WITH SUPERUSER;
					

-	Step 1) We are creating a superuser valid till 3rd Apri 2025 11:50:38 IST. Enter the following command
		
		CREATE USER mytest WITH
			LOGIN
			SUPERUSER
			CREATEDB
			CREATEROLE
			INHERIT
			NOREPLICATION
			CONNECTION LIMIT -1
			VALID UNTIL '2025-04-03T11:50:38+05:30' 
			PASSWORD '123456';
			
-	Step 2) Enter command \du into the checklist of users

	-	CREATE USER is same as CREATE ROLE command. 
	-	The difference between the two commands is when the CREATE USER command is written it is by default in the LOGIN state whereas NOLOGIN is assumed when the CRETE ROLE option is used.			

	
-	Add an existing user to a Database
	
	
		GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE guru99 TO mytest;
		
		
##	Assigning Permission
			
-	You can use user SUPERUSER permission back "mytest" using the following command

		ALTER USER mytest WITH SUPERUSER;

##	PostgreSQL Deleting User
			
		Syntax: DROP USER [user]
		
-	To delete any user, you have to make certain that the user is an owner of the database. 
-	Otherwise, you may receive an error message.

	-	ERROR:  role "username" cannot be dropped because some objects depend on it

		
		Example:

			Account "myguru" is an owner of database "demoDB."
			Enter command DROP USER myguru
			Error is shown

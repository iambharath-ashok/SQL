#	What Is SQL View In Oracle Database


-	SQL view is nothing but a logical table or a virtual table stored in a database.
- 	We can also define a VIEW as SELECT Statement with a name which is stored in a database as though it were a table.
-	All the DML commands which you can perform on a table can be performed on a view also.

##	Use of SQL View in Oracle Database

-	Views in any database are majorly used for two reasons – 

	-	Security
	-	Reducing complexity of a query
	
	
##	Security

-	Using a VIEW you can mask columns of a table and restrict any user to use the data from that column. For example,
-	Suppose you have a large table containing a mixture of both sensitive as well as general interest information. 
-	In this case it will be very handy for you to create a view which only queries the general interest columns of the original table and in turn grants privileges on this view to the general users



##	Reducing the complexity of a query
-	Another reason for using a VIEW is to reduce the complexity of a query which is made by joining various tables. For example,
-	A view built on a complex join can be created in order to include the complexity in the view itself. 
-	The result of this is a regular view object that looks to be a single table which could be queried by you as any regular table
	
	
	Syntax of SQL VIEW in Oracle Database:
		
		CREATE VIEW  view_name  AS  
			SELECT  column_name(s)  FROM  table_name  WHERE condition;
			
			
		CREATE VIEW  vw_rebellion  AS 
			SELECT  first_name,  email,  phone_number  FROM  employees;	
			
##	How to recreate a View (OR REPLACE)

		CREATE  OR REPLACE  VIEW  vw_rebellion  AS 
			SELECT  first_name,  last_name,  email,  phone_number  FROM  employees; 
			
##	How to check the definition of a SQL VIEW in Oracle Database (Describe/ desc dml)

			DESC vw_rebellion;

##	How To retrieve Rows from a VIEW in Oracle Database (SELECT ddl)
	
		SELECT * FROM vw_rebellion
		SELECT * FROM vw_rebellion ORDER BY first_name;
		SELECT * FROM vw_rebellion WHERE first_name = ‘Nancy’;
		SELECT  *  FROM  vw_rebellion   WHERE  first_name =  ‘Nancy’  ORDER BY  first_name;

##	How to UPDATE rows in a VIEW (UPDATE ddl)
			
		UPDATE vw_rebellion SET email =’nancy@example.com’ WHERE first_name =’Nancy’;

##	How to delete rows in a VIEW (DELETE ddl)
		
		DELETE FROM vw_rebellion WHERE first_name = ‘Nancy’;

##	How to insert Row in a VIEW in Oracle Database (INSERT ddl)

-	To insert a row, a view has to satisfy all the constraints on any column of underlying table over which it’s created.
- 	Insert DML is subject to several restrictions when executed on a View in Oracle database such as:
-	A view must contain the entire Not Null column from underlying table

		INSERT  INTO  vw_superheroes  VALUES  (‘Steve’, ‘Rogers’, 654765);

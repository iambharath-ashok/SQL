#	User Roles.

-	Usage of roles makes the managing and controlling of privileges an easy to handle process
-	Roles are named group of privileges that you can assign to users or other roles. Roles are the easiest and quickest way of granting permission to users. 

	-	Every role within a database has to be unique with exclusive user names as well as role names.
	-	Roles are not like schema objects as they are not contained in any schema. This means that when a user who has created a role is dropped, this has no effect on the role.
	
-	Roles are often created by Database administrators for a given database application	


##	Advantages of Roles in Oracle Database

-	Rather than assigning privileges one at a time directly to a user, you can create a role, assign privileges to that role, and then grant that role to multiple users and roles.
-	When you add or delete a privilege from a role, all users and roles that are assigned the particular role automatically receive or lose that privilege.
-	You can assign multiple roles to a user or role.
-	You can assign a password to a role.

	Syntax:

		CREATE ROLE name_role NOT IDENTIFIED| IDENTIFIED BY password | USING [schema.] package | EXTERNALLY| GLOBALLY;
		
	Query 1: Create a NOT IDENTIFIED Role

		CREATE ROLE demo1 NOT IDENTIFIED;

	Query 2: Role with Identified By Password clause

		CREATE ROLE Demo2 IDENTIFIED BY password123;

	Query 3: External Role

		CREATE USER Demo3 IDENTIFIED externally;

# LEFT OUTER Join

-	Left Outer Join is exactly opposite of Right Outer Join 
-	In left outer join, source table is placed on the left hand side of the LEFT OUTER JOIN clause i.e next to FROM clause
-	And target table will placed on RIGHT hand side of the LEFT OUTER JOIN clause
-	All the rows from the source table and only rows matching the join condition will return by Query

-	Join condition can be achieved with both USING and ON clause


	Query:
	
		SELECT 
			columns 
		FROM source_table LEFT OUTER JOIN target_table 
		ON (source_table.column = target_table.column)
		WHERE conditions
		ORDER BY column_names;
		
		
		SELECT columns
		FROM source_table LEFT OUTER JOIN target_table
		USIN (empid)
		WHERE conditions
		ORDER BY columns;

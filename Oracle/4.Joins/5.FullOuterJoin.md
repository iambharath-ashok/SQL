#	FULL Outer Joins

-	Full outer join is kind of a combination of both right outer join and left outer join because it returns all the rows from the left as well as the right side table.
	
	Syntax:

		SELECT column names FROM 

		table1 FULL OUTER JOIN / FULL JOIN table 2

		ON(expression) or USING(column_name) 

		WHERE(expression) ORDER BY column names;
		
		
##	Query 1 : Full Outer Join With ON clause

	Query:
	
		SELECT columns
		FROM emp FULL OUTER JOIN dept
		ON (emp.departmentid = dept.departmentid);
		
		SELECT   emp_name, dept_name   FROM   emp   FULL OUTER JOIN   dept   ON  (emp.emp_id  =  dept.dept_id);

## Query 2 : Full Outer Join With USING clause
	
	
	Query:
	
		SELECT   emp_name, dept_name   FROM   emp   FULL OUTER JOIN   dept   USING  (emp_id);
		
##	Query 3 : Full Outer Join With WHERE clause
		
	Query:

		SELECT   emp_name, dept_name, emp_salary   FROM   emp   FULL OUTER JOIN   dept   USING  (emp_id) 
			WHERE emp.emp_salary < 50000;
			
## Query 4 : Full Outer Join With ORDER BY clause
		
	Query:
			
		SELECT   emp_name, dept_name   FROM   emp   FULL OUTER JOIN   dept   USING  (emp_id)  
		WHERE emp.emp_salary < 50000  ORDER BY emp_name;
		
		
		SELECT   emp_name, dept_name   FROM   emp   FULL OUTER JOIN   dept   USING  (emp_id)

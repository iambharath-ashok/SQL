##	CROSS JOIN or Cartesian JOIN

-	Cross Join produces Cartesian product of the tables which are participating in the Join queries that’s why it’s also known by the name of Cartesian Join.
-	Generally we use CROSS JOIN when there is no relationship between participating tables.
	
	Syntax:

		SELECT  column names  FROM  table1  CROSS JOIN  table2  WHERE (expression)  ORDER BY  column names;

			Or 

		SELECT  column names  FROM  table1,  table2  WHERE (expression)  ORDER BY  column names;
		
##	Query 1: CROSS JOIN

	SELECT  emp_name, dept_name  FROM  emp  CROSS JOIN  dept;

##	Query 2: CROSS JOIN with WHERE clause

	SELECT  emp_name,dept_name  FROM  emp  CROSS JOIN  dept  WHERE dept_name = ‘IT’;
	
##	Query 3 : Cross Join with Order By clause


	SELECT  emp_name,dept_name  FROM  emp  CROSS JOIN  dept  WHERE dept_name = ‘IT’  ORDER BY emp_name;

	SELECT  emp_name,dept_name  FROM  emp  CROSS JOIN  dept   WHERE dept_name = ‘IT’  ORDER BY emp_name  DESC;

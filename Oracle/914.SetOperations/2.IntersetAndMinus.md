#	Intersect & Minus SQL Set Operators In Oracle Database

-	The INTERSECT operator returns rows that are common to both queries
	
	Syntax:
		
		SELECT first_name, last_name FROM cricket
		INTERSECT
		SELECT first_name, last_name FROM football;
		
-	Minus Set Operator
		
	-	The MINUS operator returns rows in the first query that are not present in the second query.
	-	The definition is self-explanatory.
	-	Therefore if we execute MINUS set operator on cricket and football tables then all the rows from cricket table which are not present in the second table i.e. football table will get returned and vice versa.
	
	Syntax:
	
		SELECT first_name, last_name FROM cricket
		MINUS
		SELECT first_name, last_name FROM football;

#	Union & Union All SQL Set Operators In Oracle Database

-	Set operators allow us to combine rows returned from two or more queries. In SQL we have four set operators
	-	Union
	-	Union All
	-	Intersect
	-	Minus	
	
	
## Union Set Operator

-	The UNION set operator returns results from all the participating queries after eliminating duplications

	SELECT first_name, last_name FROM cricket
	UNION
	SELECT first_name, last_name FROM football;
	
-	On executing this query all the rows of both the columns of both the tables will be returned except the duplicate one

##	Union All Set Operator

-	The UNION ALL operator returns results from all the participating queries, including the duplicate rows
-	This means that if we will execute the same query then we will get all the rows returned from both the tables along with the duplicate one

	SELECT first_name, last_name FROM cricket
	 UNION ALL
	 SELECT first_name, last_name FROM football;


	
## Restrictions of Set Operators in Oracle Database

-	The expressions in the SELECT lists must match in number and data type.
-	Parentheses can be used to alter the sequence of execution.
	-	The ORDER BY clause:
	-	Can appear only at the very end of the statement
-	Will accept the column name, aliases from the first SELECT statement, or the positional notation
-	Duplicate rows are automatically eliminated except in UNION ALL.
-	Column names from the first query appear in the result.
-	The output is sorted in ascending order by default except in UNION ALL.

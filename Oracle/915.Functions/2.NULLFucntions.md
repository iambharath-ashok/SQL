#	What Is NVL NULL Function In SQL

-	As we all know that unlike other programming languages NULL in oracle database does not signify zero or a blank space rather it is a value that is unavailable, unassigned, unknown, or inapplicable.
-	Thus NULL value can a problem and requires intensive handling for driving an accurate result. 

##	Problems with NULL value

-	1.	Result is always NULL.
	-	Performing any arithmetic expression containing Null as an operand then oracle will evaluate that expression as null
	
-	2.	Hard to distinguish

	-	Though some graphic user tools such as SQL Developer will show you NULL value stored in a column explicitly 
	-	But in case you are working on your database using command prompt, Linux terminal or SQL*Plus interface
	-	Then in most of the cases these tools show nothing in place of null
	
## How to overcome these problems?	

-	To handle NULL in oracle database we have a few pre-defined functions which come as freebies in the package
-	These functions are NVL, NVL2, NULLIF, COALESCE and many more

##	NVL NULL Function

-	Using NVL function you can substitute a value in the place of NULL values
-	The substituted value then temporarily replaces the NULL values in your calculations or expression. 
-	Remember that the substituted value only replaces the NULL value temporarily for the session and does not affect the value stored in the table
	
		Here is the syntax of NVL function:

			NVL (exp, replacement-exp)

		SELECT NVL (commission_pct, 0) FROM employees
		WHERE salary>13000;
		
		SELECT NVL(commission_pct,0), NVL(commission_pct,0)+100 FROM employees WHERE salary>13000;

##	What Is NVL 2 NULL Function In SQL

-	NVL2 is the second null function in the series of Null functions
-	Unlike NVL null function NVL2 function has 3 parameters. Expression, value1 and value 2. 
-	If the data returned from the first parameter is Not Null then value from the second parameter will be displayed otherwise value from the third parameter will be returned



		NVL2 (Expression, value1, value2)
		
		SELECT commission_pct, NVL2 (commission_pct, ‘Not Null’, 0) FROM employees WHERE salary>13000;
		
		SELECT commission_pct, NVL2(commission_pct, commission_pct,0) FROM employees WHERE salary>13000;
			
		
##	COALESCE

-	COALESCE ( ) is also a function which will help you in handling null values stored
-	COALESCE ( ) function does not restrict you with the number of parameters you pass to the function
-	COALESCE() function takes 'n' number of arguments
-	Coalesce ( ) function can take N number of arguments and as a result it returns the first not null parameter from the argument list.
-	 If in case all the arguments are evaluated as null then this function returns NULL as a result

		Syntax:

			COALESCE (expr1, expr2… exprn);
	
###	Examples of COALESCE ( ) Function In Oracle Database
			
	Example 1:
	
		SELECT COALESCE (null, 1, 2, 3) FROM dual;
			
	Example 2:
	
		SELECT COALESCE (‘Rebellion’, ‘RIDER’, null) FROM dual;
		
	Example 3:

		SELECT first_name, last_name, mobile FROM avengers;
		SELECT first_name, last_name, landline FROM avengers;
		SELECT first_name, last_name, mobile, landline FROM avengers;
		SELECT first_name, last_name, COALESCE (mobile, landline) AS contact FROM avengers;

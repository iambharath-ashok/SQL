## CREATE TABLE

-	While working on a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)
	-	our maximum time is spent on handling data in tables mainly because RDBMS stores data in database object called tables
	
-	Tables are just a collection of unique Rows and Columns	
-	Where every single row is called tuple and every single column is known as attribute of the table

		
	-	Every Single Row –> Tuple
    
	-	Every Single Column –> Attribute
		
	-	Every column as well as row should be unique.
	
-	Definition:
	- Tables in RDBMS are a data-structure which helps in organizing data in Rows and Columns.	

	
-	To create a table in Oracle schema we use CREATE TABLE command. 
	-	Syntax of Create table statement is as follows:
		
				CREATE TABLE table_name  
				(
					Column_name1  Data-Type(size) Constraint,
					Column_name2  Data-Type(size) Constraint,
					…
					Column_name1000  Data-Type(size)  Constraint
				);
	
	
	#### Constraints on creating table
	
	-	With oracle we have a maximum limit of 1000 columns in a table but there is no limit whatsoever on the number of rows. 
	-	This means you can put unlimited rows in your table.
	-	There are a few rules which we have to follow while naming a table or columns of the table.		
	-	These rules are as follows:	

			Table names and column names:

				-	Must begin with a letter
				-	Must be 1–30 characters long
				-	Must contain only A–Z, a–z, 0–9, _, $, and #
				-	Must not duplicate the name of another object owned by the same user
				-	Must not be an Oracle server–reserved word


-	To create a table in your schema you will require CREATE TABLE system privilege.
-	There are 3 different ways for creating a table

	-	Using SQLPlus command line prompt
	-	Using GUI
	-	Using Enterprise Manager from Browser

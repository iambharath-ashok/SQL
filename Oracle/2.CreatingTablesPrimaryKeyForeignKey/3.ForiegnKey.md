#	Foreign Key

-	Foreign key is an Input/output data constraint which is also known as referential integrity constraint. 
-	Foreign key represents a link or say a relationship between columns of tables.

## Types Of Foreign Key Constraint

-	Similar to primary key constraint Foreign Key constraint is also of two types:


	-	Simple Foreign key constraint and
	-	Composite Foreign key constraint


## What Are Simple & Composite Foreign Key Constraints?

-	Simple Foreign Key Constraint
	
	-	Constraint which involves only one column in foreign key in child table 
	-	One column in reference key in parent table is called Simple Foreign Key
	
-	Composite Foreign Key Constraints

	-	 constraint which involves more than one column in foreign key in the child table as well as more than one column in reference key in the parent table is called Composite Foreign Key
	

##  Features of Foreign Key

-	Referenced key in parent table must either be a Primary Key or a Unique Key.
-	Records in parent table cannot be updated if child record exists.
-	Foreign Key Constraint can be specified only on child table and not on parent table
-	We cannot define a foreign key constraint in a CREATE TABLE statement that contains an AS sub query clause
	-	Instead, you must create the table without the constraint and then add it later with an ALTER TABLE statement


##	Tables Of Foreign Key Constraint

-	Foreign key involves two different tables.
-	First one is PARENT TABLE or referenced Table and the second one is CHILD TABLE or foreign table.

	-	The column of parent table which will get referenced by foreign key must be either Primary Key or Unique Key.
	-	Column(s) in child table can contain NULL or Duplicate values while the vice versa is not true.
	-	Column(s) of parent table & column(s) of child table which are participating in foreign key should be of the same data-type and size (column width).
	
## How to create/ Define Foreign key

-	Can define foreign key constraint either by using CREATE TABLE statement or by using ALTER TABLE statement. 

	### Defining Foreign Key Using Create table at Column Level
	
	-	This way of defining constraint is called column level because we define the constraint with column definition while creating table.

		Syntax:
	
			Column_name Datatype(size) REFERENCES parent_table_name (parent_column_name)
		
		Query:
			
			CREATE TABLE author
			(
				author_id NUMBER(3) CONSTRAINT athr_aid_pk PRIMARY KEY,
				author_name VARCHAR2(30)
			);
			
		Query:
				
			CREATE TABLE book
			(
				book_id NUMBER(10),
				book_name VARCHAR(20),
				book_auth_id NUMBER(3) CONSTRAINT book_auth_id_fk REFERENCES author(author_id)
			);

	###	How to define foreign key using CREATE TABLE at table Level
		
	-	CONSTRAINT constraint_name FOREIGN KEY(child_table_column) REFERENCES Parent_table_name(parent_table_column)

		Query:
			
			CREATE TABLE books
			  (
			  book_id  NUMBER(3)  CONSTRAINT  bok_bi_pk  PRIMARY KEY,
			  book_title   VARCHAR2(30),
			  book_price  NUMBER(3),
			  book_author_id   NUMBER(3),
			  CONSTRAINT  bok_ai_fk  FOREIGN KEY  (book_author_id) REFERENCES  author(author_id)
			  );

##	Define Foreign Key Using ALTER TABLE statement

	Syntax :
	
		ALTER TABLE  child_table_name  ADD  FOREIGN KEY  (child_column)  REFERENCES  parent_table_name(parent_column)
	
	Query:
		ALTER TABLE  books  ADD  CONSTRAINT  bok_ai_fk  FOREIGN KEY  (book_author_id) REFERENCES  author(author_id);
		
-	If you try to delete a parent table which has a primary or a unique key referenced by child table then oracle will give you a SQL Error: ORA-02449.
-	However if you want then you can still drop the child table without any error.

#	How To Create A New User Account In Oracle Database
-	We can create new user or use existing users


## Create a new user using Create user statement.

-	Syntax of Create User statement

		CREATE USER username IDENTIFIED BY password/externally/globally 
		DEFAULT TABLESPACE tablespace_name TEMPERORY TABLESPACE tablespace_name 
		QUOTA size/unlimited ON tablespace_name 
		PROFILE profile_name 
		PASSWORD expire 
		ACCOUNT lock/unlock;

-	Password: Password clause lets you create a local user and indicates that the user must specify password to log on to the database
-	Externally: This clause helps you in creating an external user.
	-	These external users and their authentication are managed by external services such as operating system.
	-	The user who is authenticated by the operating system can easily access the database without being requested for a password
-	Globally: Through Global users you can keep the login or authentication information at a Central Oracle Security Server rather than having passwords in every database to be accessed


-	Default Tablespace: In the default tablespace you have to specify the name of tablespace where this user will create its object
	-	By objects I mean tables, indexes, synonyms etc
	-	This is an optional clause, if you omit this clause then all the objects created by this user gets stored in the database default tablespace which is “users” tablespace in most cases
	

-	Temporary Tablespace: All the temporary segments created by this user get stored here. Temporary segment such as temporary tables	
-	Quota clause: Quota clause can help you in specifying the maximum amount of space that the user can allocate in the tablespace
-	Profile clause: Using profile clause you can specify the profile you want to assign to the user.

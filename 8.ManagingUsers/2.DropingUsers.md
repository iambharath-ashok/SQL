#	How To Drop A User When It Is Connected To The Database

-	DROP USER is a DDL statement. 
-	DDL statement does not support ROLLBACK command which means once you have dropped the user you cannot get it back using ROLLBACK command.
		
	Query:	
		
		DROP   USER   John;
		DROP   USER   john   CASCADE;

##	There are few things about droping users

-	If the user’s schema contains tables, then Oracle Database drops the tables and automatically drops any referential integrity constraints on tables in other schemas that refer to primary and unique keys on these tables
-	If this clause results in tables being dropped, then the database also drops all domain indexes created on columns of those tables and invokes appropriate drop routines.
-	Oracle Database invalidates, but does not drop, the following objects in other schemas:
-	Views or synonyms for objects in the dropped user’s schema
-	Stored procedures, functions, or packages that query objects in the dropped user’s schema
-	Oracle Database does not drop materialized views in other schemas that are based on tables in the dropped user’s schema. However, because the base tables no longer exist, the materialized views in the other schemas can no longer be refreshed.
-	Oracle Database drops all triggers in the user’s schema.
-	Oracle Database does not drop roles created by the user.

#	MySQL UNION - Complete Tutorial


##	What is a union?

-	Unions combine the results from multiple SELECT queries into a consolidated result set.

-	The only requirements for this to work is that the number of columns should be the same from all the SELECT queries which needs to be combined .

		Syntax:
		
			SELECT `column1`,` column1 FROM `table1`
			UNION DISTINCT
			SELECT ` column1`,` column1`  FROM `table2`;
			
			
			SELECT `column1`,` column1` FROM `table1`
			UNION ALL
			SELECT ` column1`,` column1`  FROM `table2`;
			
			
			
##	Why use unions

-	Suppose there is a flaw in your database design and you are using two different tables meant for the same purpose. 
-	You want to consolidate these two tables into one while omitting any duplicate records from creeping into the new table.
-	You can use UNION in such cases.

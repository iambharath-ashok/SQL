#	MySQL Wildcards Tutorial: Like, NOT Like, Escape, ( % ), ( _ )


##	What are wildcards?

-	Wildcards are used in conjunction with the LIKE comparison operator or the NOT LIKE comparison operator
	
	
	Query without Like Operator:
	
		SELECT * FROM members WHERE postal_address = 'Austin , TX' OR  postal_address = Dallas , TX OR postal_address = Iola,TX OR postal_adress = Houston ,TX';
	
	Query with Like Operator:
	
		SELECT * FROM  members  WHERE postal_address  like '% TX';
		
		
##	Types of wildcards


-	% the percentage
	
	-	% the percentage character is used to specify a pattern of zero (0) or more characters. It has the following basic syntax.

	-	SELECT statements... WHERE fieldname LIKE 'xxx%';
	
		"SELECT statement..." is the standard SQL SELECT command.
		"WHERE" is the key word used to apply the filter.
		"LIKE" is the comparison operator that is used in conjunction with wildcards
		'xxx' is any specified starting pattern such as a single character or more and "%" matches any number of characters starting from zero (0).
			
		Query to match %code% anywhere in the string:
		
			SELECT * FROM movies WHERE title LIKE '%code%';
			SELECT * FROM movies WHERE title LIKE '%code';
			SELECT * FROM movies WHERE title LIKE 'code%';


-	_ underscore wildcard

	-	The underscore wildcard is used to match exactly one character.
	-	Let's suppose that we want to search for all the movies that were released in the years 200x where x is exactly one character that could be any value
	-	We would use the underscore wild card to achieve that. The script below select all the movies that were released in the year "200x"

		
	Query:
	
		SELECT * FROM movies WHERE year_released LIKE '200_';


		
-	NOT Like

	-	The NOT logical operator can be used together with the wildcards to return rows that do not match the specified pattern
	-	Suppose we want to get movies that were not released in the year 200x. 
	-	We would use the NOT logical operator together with the underscore wildcard to get our results. Below is the script that does that.

		
	Query:
	
		SELECT * FROM movies WHERE year_released NOT LIKE '200_';

		
-	Escape keyword.
	
	-	The ESCAPE keyword is used to escape pattern matching characters such as the (%) percentage and underscore (_) if they form part of the data.

	-	Let's suppose that we want to check for the string "67%" we can use;
	
		
		
		Query:
		
			SELECT * FROM movies WHERE title LIKE '67#%%' ESCAPE '#';

	-	Note the double "%%" in the LIKE clause, the first one in red "%" is treated as part of the string to be searched for. 
	-	The other one is used to match any number of characters that follow.
	
	
	-	The same query will also work if we use something like

			SELECT * FROM movies WHERE title LIKE '67=%%' ESCAPE '=';

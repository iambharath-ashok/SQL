#	MySQL GROUP BY and HAVING Clause with Examples

-	The GROUP BY clause is a SQL command that is used to group rows that have the same values
-	The GROUP BY clause is used in the SELECT statement
-	Optionally it is used in conjunction with aggregate functions to produce summary reports from the database
-	summarizing data from the database
-	The queries that contain the GROUP BY clause are called grouped queries and only return a single row for every grouped item.

##	GROUP BY Syntax

-	SELECT statements... GROUP BY column_name1[,column_name2,...] [HAVING condition];

-	SELECT `gender` FROM `members` ;
-	SELECT `gender` FROM `members` GROUP BY `gender`;


##	Grouping using multiple columns


-	SELECT `category_id`,`year_released` FROM `movies` ;
-	SELECT `category_id`,`year_released` FROM `movies` GROUP BY `category_id`,`year_released`;


-	The GROUP BY clause operates on both the category id and year released to identify unique rows in our above example.
-	If the category id is the same but the year released is different, then a row is treated as a unique one 
-	If the category id and the year -released is the same for more than one row, then it's considered a duplicate and only one row is shown



##	Grouping and aggregate functions

-	SELECT `gender`,COUNT(`membership_number`)  FROM `members` GROUP BY `gender`;
	
##	Restricting query results using the HAVING clause

-	SELECT * FROM `movies` GROUP BY `category_id`,`year_released` HAVING `category_id` = 8;

##	Group By Clause

-	The GROUP BY Clause is used to group rows with same values .
-	The GROUP BY Clause is used together with the SQL SELECT statement.
-	The SELECT statement used in the GROUP BY clause can only be used contain column names, aggregate functions, constants and expressions.
-	The HAVING clause is used to restrict the results returned by the GROUP BY clause.

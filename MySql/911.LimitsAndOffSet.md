##	What is the LIMIT keyword?


-	The limit keyword is used to limit the number of rows returned in a  query result.  
-	It can be used in conjunction with the SELECT, UPDATE OR DELETE commands LIMIT keyword syntax

##	Using the OFF SET in the LIMIT query


-	The OFF SET value is also most often used together with the LIMIT keyword. The OFF SET value allows us to specify which row to start from retrieving data


	SELECT * FROM `members` LIMIT 1, 2;

## What is DATA ?

-	Data is a piece of information or fact, collection of facts
-	A picture , image , file , pdf etc can also be considered data.
-	In simple words data can be facts related to any object in consideration.





## What is Database?

-	Database is a systematic collection of data
-	Database is container, where all the data is stored


## What is Database Management or DBMS

-	DBMS is a collection of programs that is used to manage the collection of data is organized, structured
-	DBMS enables its users to connect to DB, Manage, organize, manipulate the data in DB 
	
-	DBMS is collection of Programs that helps to:
	
	-	Access the data
	-	Manipulate the data
	-	Represent the data

-	DBMS is a technology to store and retrieve the data at most efficiency along with security measures	
	
##	Types of DBMS

-	Hierarchical DBMS 
	-	Has parent-child representation of storing the data

-	N/w DBMS
	
	-	supports Many to many relationships

-	Relational DBMS
	-	Relational DBMS usually have pre-defined data types that they can support
	-	Defines relationship b/w tables 
	-	Supports only predefined data types
	-	Unlike network DBMS, RDBMS does not support many to many relationships
	
-	Object Oriented DBMS
	-	Supports storage of  its new data types
	-	Data is stored in the form of Objects
	-	Objects has its own attributes and method that define, what they have to do with data 
	
	

##	SQL

-	Structured Query Language is a programming language that used for managing relational databases
-	With SQL, we can retrieve data from db, insert, update, delete, modify the data
-	Relational DB's like Oracle, MySql, MS SQL uses SQL
-	Queries and other SQL operations are written as statements
	-	select, delete, update, alter, etc
	
## What is NoSQL ?
-	Its main characteristic is its non-adherence to Relational Database Concepts.
-	NOSQL means "Not only SQL".
-	When you use relational database for massive volumes of data , the system starts getting slow in terms of response time
-	To overcome this , we could of course "scale up" our systems by upgrading our existing hardware.
-	The alternative to the above problem would be to distribute our database load on multiple hosts as the load increases.
-	This is known as "scaling out"
-	NOSQL database are non-relational databases that scale out better than relational databases 
-	NOSQL are designed with web applications in mind
-	They do not use SQL to query the data and do not follow strict schemas like relational models.
-	With NoSQL, ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) features are not guaranteed always


## Advantages of SQL vs NoSQL

-	SQL(relational) databases have a mature data storage and management model . This is crucial for enterprise users
-	SQL databases support the notion of views which allow users to only see data that they are authorized to view
-	SQL databases support stored procedure sql which allow database developers to implement part of the business logic into the database
-	SQL databases have better security models compared to NoSQL databases
	
## MySQL

-	Open Source RDBMS
-	Multi user access
-	Support multi storage engines
-	Works on many platforms
	-	MySQL is cross platform which means it runs on a number of different platforms such as Windows, Linux, and Mac OS etc


##	Why use MySQL?

-	MySQL supports multiple storage engines 
-	SQL server only support a single storage engine
-	MySQL has high performance compared to other relation database systems
-	Cost effective, it's relatively cheaper in terms of cost when compared to other relational databases
-	Cross platform - MySQL works on many platforms which means it can be deployed on most machines. 
	-	Other systems such as MS SQL Server only run on the windows platform

	-	Administration of Server
	
## Two Types of Database Techniques

-   Normalization
-   ER Modeling

## Normalization


### What is Normalization?

-	Normalization is a database design technique which organizes tables in a manner that reduces redundancy and dependency of data
-	It divides larger tables to smaller tables and links them using relationships.

####	1NF (First Normal Form) Rules

-	Each table cell should contain a single value.
-	Each record needs to be unique.
	
-	What is a KEY?
	
	-	A KEY is a value used to identify a record in a table uniquely. 
	-	A KEY could be a single column or combination of multiple columns
	-	Columns in a table that are NOT used to identify a record uniquely are called non-key columns.
	
-	What is a Primary Key?
	
	-	A primary is a single column value used to identify a database record uniquely
	-	It has following attributes

		-	A primary key cannot be NULL
		-	A primary key value must be unique
		-	The primary key values should rarely be changed
		-	The primary key must be given a value when a new record is inserted
		
-	What is Composite Key?

	-	A composite key is a primary key composed of multiple columns used to identify a record uniquely
	
-	What are transitive functional dependencies?

	-	A transitive functional dependency is when changing a non-key column, might cause any of the other non-key columns to change
	
####	2NF (Second Normal Form) Rules

-	Rule 1- Be in 1NF
-	Rule 2- Single Column Primary Key

	-	It is clear that we can't move forward to make our simple database in 2nd Normalization form unless we partition the table above.
	-	We have divided our 1NF table into two tables viz. Table 1 and Table2. 
	-	Table 1 contains member information.
	-	Table 2 contains information on movies rented.

	-	We have introduced a new column called Membership_id which is the primary key for table 1.
	-	Records can be uniquely identified in Table 1 using membership id

-	Database - Foreign Key
	-	Foreign Key references the primary key of another Table! It helps connect your Tables
	-	A foreign key can have a different name from its primary key
	-	It ensures rows in one table have corresponding rows in another
	-	Unlike the Primary key, they do not have to be unique. Most often they aren't
	-	Foreign keys can be null even though primary keys can not 	

-	
	
#### 	3NF (Third Normal Form) Rules

-	Rule 1- Be in 2NF
-	Rule 2- Has no transitive functional dependencies		

	-	We have again divided our tables and created a new table which stores Salutations. 
	-	There are no transitive functional dependencies, and hence our table is in 3NF
	-	In Table 3 Salutation ID is primary key, and in Table 1 Salutation ID is foreign to primary key in Table 3


#### Summary

-	Normalization helps produce database systems that are cost-effective and have better security models.
-	Functional dependencies are a very important component of the normalize data process
-	Most database systems are normalized database up to the third normal forms.
-	A primary key uniquely identifies are record in a Table and cannot be null
-	A foreign key helps connect table and references a primary key
-	Normalization is a technique that organizing table in such a way that it reduces data dependency and redundancy
-	1 NF, 2 NF, 3 NF , B NF
-	1 NF
	-	Each table cell should have single value, basically all the records must be unique

-	2 NF 
	-	Should be 1 NF and also should have a single column primary key
	
-	3 NF
	-	Should be 2 NF and must not have any transitive functional dependencies

	
## What is ER Modeling?

-	ER Diagrams play a very important role in the database designing process. 
-	They serve as a non-technical communication tool for technical and non-technical people.	
-	Entities represent real world things; they can be conceptual as a sales order or physical such as a customer.
-	All entities must be given unique names.
-	ER models also allow the database designers to identify and define the relations that exist among entities

##	SQL Command Categories

-	DML 
	-	SQL commands deals with manipulation of data stored in DB
	-	Insert, Delete, Update, Select
-	DDL
	-	SQL Commands used to define the database schema
	-	CREATE, TRUNCATE, DROP, ALTER, RENAME, COMMENT, REPLACE
	
-	DCL
	-	GRANT, REVOKE	
	
-	TCL 
	-	COMMIT, ROLLBACK, Savepoint,Set Transaction
	
	
##	Entity Relationship  Diagram

-	DB Modeling means Database designing
-	Database can be design either using Entity Relationship Diagram or Normalize the Database
-	ER - Entity-Relationship diagram is a diagram where we represent the real world objects as entities and relationship b/w them


##	Different types of Keys

-	Candidate Keys

	-	Uniquely identifies the tuples
	-	Must be Non-null and unique
	-	There can be multiple Candidate keys in the tables
	
-	Super Keys

	-	Similar to Candidate keys
	
-	Primary Keys

	-	There can be only one Primary Key and rest of others are Candidate keys
	-	Primay Key is combination of unique and non-null
	
-	Alternate Keys

	-	Candidate keys other than primary keys are alternate keys
	
-	Foreign Keys
	-	Used to reference the parent tables
	

	
##	SQL Attributes Data Types

-	Numeric
	-	Int, small int, float, real, double, precision, decimal
-	Character- string
	-	char, varchar, clob
-	Boolean

## Constraints

-	Unique - make sure that all the values in the column are different
-	Not Null - make sure that NULL value can't stored in the column
-	Default - consists of set of default values, when no value is provided for a column
-	Check - ensures that all the values in the column satisfies a specific condition
-	Index	-	used to retrieve data quickly

##	Relational Algebra and Relational Calculus


-	Unary Relational operators

	-	Select Operation
		-	choose a subset of tuples from table based on the conditions
	-	Project Operation
		-	Select certain columns of the tables and discards remaining columns
	-	Rename Operation
		-	RENAME is unary operator used for renaming attributes of a relation
		
		
	
-	Set Operations

	-	Set Operations is used to join the results from two different queries

		-	Union : Combines rows from both Queries
		- 	Union All : Combines rows from both Queries along with duplicates
		-	Intersect: Keeps rows only common in both Queries
		-	Minus: Keeps rows from left query which are not present in right query
	
	-	Cartesian Product or Cross Join
	
		-	Table 1 * Table 2
		-	SELECT table.col1, table2.col2 FROM table1, table2 WHERE table2.col3 = 'data';
	

## Nested Queries

-	Nested Queries are the queries which has outer and inner queries
-	Subquery is a query nested within another query such as select, insert, update or delete

	Queries:
	
		1. Nested Query with Union
		
			(SELECT DISTINCT col1 
			FROM table1,table2
			WHERE table1.col2 = table2.col1)
			UNION
			(SELECT DISTINCT 
			FROM table1,table2
			WHERE table2.col1 = table1.col4 AND table2.col1 = 'aaa');
		
		2.	IN Operator
		
			SELECT DISTINCT Essn
			FROM  works_on
			WHERE (pno,hours) IN
			(SELECT pnum, hours
			FROM work_on 
			WHERE Essn = '233443');
			
		3.	Exists
		
			SELECT fname, lname
			FROM employee
			WHERE EXISTS (SELECT * FROM  dependent WHERE ssn = Essn)
		
		4.	 LIKE Operator with birth date b/w 1960's
		
				SELECT * FROM emp WHERE bdate LIKE '__6_____';
		
		
## Triggers

-	Triggers are SQL Statements stored in database and will gets executed or fired whenever an event assosiated with a table occurs
-	Trigger can be executed before or after the data is changed by Insert, update, delete statements

	-	Before Insert
	-	After Insert
	-	Before Update
	-	After Update
	-	After Delete
	-	Before Delete
	
	
## Transactions

-	Transactions is a set of tasks grouped into a single execution unit
-	Transaction begins with specific task and ends when all the tasks in the group gets executed successfully
-	Transaction has only two results : success or failure

	-	SET TRASACTION
	
		-	Places a name on the transaction
		
	-	COMMIT
		
		-	This command saves the transactions to the database since the last commit or rollback command
		
	-	ROLLBACK
		
		-	Rollback command is used to rollback all the changes or undo changes since last commit or rollback
		
	- 	SavePoint
		
		-	SavePoint 	create a point within the group of transactions
		
	-	Release SavePoint
	
		-	Release SavePoint is used to remove the savepoint

# MySQL


## What is DATA ?

-	Data is a piece of information or fact, collection of facts


## What is Database?

-	Database is container, where all the data is stored


## What is Database Management or DBMS

-	DBMS is a collection of programs that is used to manage the collection of data is organized, structured
-	DBMS is connect to DB, Manage, organize, manipulate the data in DB 
	
-	DBMS is collection of Programs that helps to:
	
	-	Access the data
	-	Manipulate the data
	-	Represent the data

-	DBMS is a technology to store and retrieve the data at most efficiency along with security measures	
	
##	Types of DBMS

-	Hierarchical DBMS 
	-	Has parent-child representation of storing the data
-	N/w DBMS
	-	supports Many to many relationships
-	Relational DBMS
	-	Defines relationship b/w tables 
	-	Supports only predefined data types
-	Object Oriented DBMS
	-	Supports its own data types
	-	Data is stored in the form of Objects
	-	Objects has its own attributes and method that define, what they have to do with data 
	
	

##	SQL

-	Structured Query Language is a programming language that used for managing relational databases
-	With SQL, we can retrieve data from db, insert, update, delete, modify the data
-	Relational DB's like Oracle, MySql, MS SQL uses SQL
-	Queries and other SQL operations are written as statements
	-	select, delete, update, alter, etc
	
	
## MySQL

-	Open Source RDBMS
-	Multi user access
-	Support multi storage engines
-	Works on many platforms


## Features of MySQL

-	Transaction Support
- 	Open source
-	Ease of Management
-	24 *7 supports
-	High Availability
-	Scalability
-	Secure 


## SQL Workbench


-	Has 3 modules

	-	DB designing and modelling modules
	-	Database Development
	-	Administration of Server
	
	
##	SQL Command Categories

-	DML 
	-	SQL commands deals with manipulation of data stored in DB
	-	Insert, Delete, Update, Select
-	DDL
	-	SQL Commands used to define the database schema
	-	CREATE, TRUNCATE, DROP, ALTER, RENAME, COMMENT
	
-	DCL
	-	GRANT, REVOKE	
	
-	TCL 
	-	COMMIT, ROLLBACK, Savepoint,Set Transaction
	
	
##	Entity Relationship  Diagram

-	DB Modeling means Database designing
-	Database can be design either using Entity Relationship Diagram or Normalize the Database
-	ER - Entity-Relationship diagram is a diagram where we represent the real world objects as entities and relationship b/w them


##	Different types of Keys

-	Candidate Keys

	-	Uniquely identifies the tuples
	-	Must be Non-null and unique
	-	There can be multiple Candidate keys in the tables
	
-	Super Keys

	-	Similar to Candidate keys
	
-	Primary Keys

	-	There can be only one Primary Key and rest of others are Candidate keys
	-	Primay Key is combination of unique and non-null
	
-	Alternate Keys

	-	Candidate keys other than primary keys are alternate keys
	
-	Foreign Keys
	-	Used to reference the parent tables
	
## Normalization

-	Normalization is a technique that organizing table in such a way that it reduces data dependency and redundancy
-	1 NF, 2 NF, 3 NF , B NF
-	1 NF
	-	Each table cell should have single value, basically all the records must be unique
	
	
-	2 NF 
	-	Should be 1 NF and also should have a single column primary key
	
-	3 NF
	-	Should be 2 NF and must not have any transitive functional dependencies
	
##	SQL Attributes Data Types

-	Numeric
	-	Int, small int, float, real, double, precision, decimal
-	Character- string
	-	char, varchar, clob
-	Boolean
	-	true, false, unknown
-	Date and Time
	-	date, time
-	Timestamp
-	Bit string
	- bit
	
## Constraints

-	Unique - make sure that all the values in the column are different
-	Not Null - make sure that NULL value can't stored in the column
-	Default - consists of set of default values, when no value is provided for a column
-	Check - ensures that all the values in the column satisfies a specific condition
-	Index	-	used to retrieve data quickly


##	SQL Data Definition Commands



-	ALTER TABLE
-	DROP TABLE
-	CREATE TABLE 
-	CREATE INDEX
-	ALTER INDEX
-	DROP INDEX
-	CREATE VIEW
-	DROP VIEW
-	ALTER VIEW
-	CREATE SCHEMA 
-	CREATE TABLE
	-	NOT NULL
	-	UNIQUE
	-	PRIMARY KEY
	-	DEFAULT 
	- 	CHECK
	-	FOREIGN KEY
	
## 	SQL Data Manipulation Commands

-	UPDATE 
-	COMMIT
-	ROLLBACK
-	DELETE
-	INSERT
-	SELECT
	-	WHERE
	-	GROUP BY
	-	HAVING 
	-	ORDER BY
	
##	Functions and Operators
